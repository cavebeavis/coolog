# Coolog

Coolog is a logging interface based upon [Chris Hines' Slide Deck](https://go-talks.appspot.com/github.com/ChrisHines/talks/structured-logging/structured-logging.slide) and [gokit's log package](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-kit/kit@v0.10.0/log).

The motivation for this package can be found here: https://medium.com/@briankovacs/golang-interfaces-60e459ebd7c0
